            <h2>A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h2>
            <p>I chose this topic because FlipTop is a unique cultural phenomenon that has elevated rap battles to mainstream recognition in the Philippines. It combines lyrical mastery, wit, and humor, making it a fascinating subject. As a fan of both music and poetry, I appreciate how FlipTop showcases the artistry of language and the creative expression of its participants.</p>
