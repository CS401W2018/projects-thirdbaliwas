            <h2>Bringing Hip-Hop to the Mainstream</h2>
            <p>Before FlipTop, the hip-hop scene in the Philippines was mostly underground, with limited mainstream recognition. Through viral battles and online sharing, FlipTop brought the art of freestyle rap to millions. The league's YouTube channel alone has garnered billions of views, solidifying its place in pop culture.</p>
