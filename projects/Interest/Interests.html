        <h2>Dota 2</h2>
        <p>
            Dota 2 has been a significant part of my life for years now. I've spent countless hours exploring the mechanics, strategies, and the community surrounding this iconic MOBA. My passion for Dota extends beyond just playing, I also follow professional tournaments like The International with great enthusiasm. I enjoy analyzing the strategies, drafts, and individual performances of top-tier teams.

        <h2>Musci Lover</h2>
        <p>
            Music has been a constant companion throughout my life. I enjoy listening to a wide variety of genres, from classic rock to modern pop to rap. My musical journey began in my youth days. Since then, I've developed a deep appreciation for both the art of music and the emotions it evokes. Some of my favorite artists and bands include Kendrick Lamar, Post Malone, LANY. but I'm always open to discovering new music. I enjoy exploring different genres and styles, and I'm always learning something new about the world of music.
